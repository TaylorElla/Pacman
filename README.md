# Pacman
## Exercise on pacman game
<img src= "pacman.png" width='300'/>

Description of the project: In this exercise, we were given starter files to create a web page that produces a PacMan on the click of a button. I added a black background and styled the buttons with a white dash border and white font.

How to Run: This exercise is inteded to run on a web browser. Drag and drop the index.html file onto your browser to view the Pacman Factory. Click the 'Add Pacman' button to add pacman to the page. Click 'Start Game' to see the pacmen bounce around the screen.

Roadmap of future improvements: I would like to introduce new characters to the factory game. For example, adding Pacman fruit and ghosts.
